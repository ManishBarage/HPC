Batch: B2

Title of practical: Study and implementation of basic OpenMP clauses
Implement following Programs using OpenMP with C:
    1. Vector Scalar Addition
    2. Calculation of value of Pi
Analyse the performance of your programs for different number of threads and Data size.

Problem Statement 1: Vector Scalar Addition
Screenshots:







Information: 
Analysis: As number of threads increase, time taken to perform the operations is reduced











Problem Statement 2: Calculation of value of Pi

Screenshots:












Information: Pi calculation can be done by various methods. Here the method used is Monte Carlo method of π calculation. In this method, pi is calculated using random nuber generation. 

Formula Used: 
π = 4 * (no_of_points_in_circle / no_of_points_in_square)

Analysis: As we increase number of points precision goes on increasing. The method relies on probabilistic sampling. As the sample size increases, the estimate of π converges to its true value.
